# Upstream and release workflow

The fork tracks Telegram Desktop in two separate ways:

- `dev` is the integration stream. It is useful for resolving fork conflicts early, but it is not a release version by itself.
- `vX.Y.Z` tags are the stable stream. A stable fork release should be based on a Telegram tag and should keep the same Telegram version in `Telegram/build/version`.

The fork is developed on the VPS clone in `/root/yunogram`; nothing is built or
merged on a Windows machine any more. A blobless clone is enough, submodules are
only needed by the build and the build runs in Actions:

```bash
git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/si5830351-stack/Yunogram.git
```

Preview the newest stable tag:

```bash
scripts/sync_upstream.sh
```

Merge it:

```bash
scripts/sync_upstream.sh --ref v7.1.1 --apply
```

The script creates a `sync/upstream/...` branch and leaves conflicts in the
worktree. It does not abort on them on purpose: every sync so far conflicted in
fork code, and deciding those cases is the work. `scripts/sync_upstream.ps1` is
the older Windows-only version and aborts instead, which made it unusable as an
apply step.

Two recurring conflicts are worth knowing in advance. `Telegram/Resources/winrc/*.rc`
conflicts every time because upstream bumps the version and the fork keeps its
branding there; resolve as fork branding plus the upstream version. Files under
`.github/workflows/` come back as deleted-by-us because the fork removed the
upstream workflows; keep them deleted.

After resolving, run both checks:

```bash
python tools/verify_private_fork.py --require-autoupdate
python tools/check_merge_artifacts.py <fork ref before the merge> <upstream tag>
```

The second one exists because the dangerous merge results are the ones git
produces without a conflict. When both sides add the same declaration, git keeps
both copies and only the compiler complains, an hour into the build. The same
applies in reverse: upstream removing an enum value that fork code still uses
merges cleanly and fails to compile.

Fast-forward `main`, then run the workflow on `main` with `publish` enabled.
One run builds, packages, tags and publishes. Run it with `libraries_only`
afterwards if upstream changed `prepare.py`, so the `main` cache matches the
new libraries.

The Windows installer is per-user and is registered by Inno Setup in the current user's installed-programs list. It installs to the existing user-data-compatible location so the built-in updater can replace files without requiring administrator rights. The portable ZIP remains a separate artifact.

Releases are built by the `Windows x64` workflow on GitHub Actions. Nothing is
compiled by hand any more.

The workflow is split so that a failed stage can be re-run on its own:

- `verify-fork` — fork invariants, runs on pull requests too.
- `libraries` — builds the third-party libraries into the Actions cache. It uses
  no secrets. The cache is written even when the step fails or runs out of time,
  so re-running only this job continues from the stages that already finished.
- `build` — configures and compiles the client with auto-update enabled and
  uploads `Yunogram.exe`, `Updater.exe` and `Packer.exe`.
- `package` — builds the installer and the portable archive with checksums.
- `publish` — tags the commit, creates the GitHub release and publishes the
  update package.

`workflow_dispatch` has two inputs:

- `libraries_only` builds and caches the third-party libraries and stops there.
  Run it on `main` after a merge so the default branch cache stays current:
  every other ref, tags included, can restore the default branch cache but not
  each other's.
- `publish` tags the commit and publishes once the build is green. This is the
  normal way to release — one run builds, packages, tags and publishes, and
  nothing is tagged if the build fails.

Release notes live in `docs/release-notes/<version>.md` and are committed with
the merge. The workflow refuses to publish without them. Pushing an
`yunogram-v*` tag by hand still works and takes its notes from the tag
annotation, but it costs a second full build, so prefer the input.

Auto-update is enabled by passing `YUNOGRAM_ENABLE_AUTOUPDATE=ON` together with
`YUNOGRAM_UPDATE_PREFIX` to `build_yunogram.bat`. The prefix must not end with a
slash: the client appends `/current4` and the package path to it.
`YUNOGRAM_PREPARE_ONLY=1` stops the script once the libraries are ready, which is
what the `libraries` job uses.

Update packages are signed with an RSA-2048 fork key. The public halves live in
`Telegram/SourceFiles/config.h` and `Telegram/SourceFiles/_other/packer.cpp`.
The private halves belong in `Telegram/SourceFiles/_other/packer_private.h`,
which is ignored by git and must never be committed. Losing the private key
means installed clients stop accepting updates and have to be replaced by hand.

A local build can still publish an update by hand:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/publish_update.ps1 -Publish
```

The script runs Packer over `Yunogram.exe` and `Updater.exe`, writes the
`current4` manifest and uploads both as the latest release of the update
channel repository. Without `-Publish` it only prepares the files locally.

Clients compare the `released` number in the manifest against their own
`AppVersion`, so an update only reaches builds with a lower version.
